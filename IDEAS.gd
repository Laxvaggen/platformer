stun kinda broken
for some reason it is possible to jump VERY HIGH after shield???


Elemental abilites with bow, take from pimen itch.io
arrow types correspond to element/spell
	something like
		-"toxic arrow": covers the ground in toxic sludge upon landing
		-"burst arrow": explodes when fired (like a shotgun blast)
		-"sniper arrow": flies fast, extreme damage on hit (something like pimen holy effect 2 for hit fx)
		
  
mana/stamina system: 
	mana decreases on 
		-arrow fired, depending on spell strength
		-shield damage taken
	stamina decreases on
		-bow held ready
		-shield held
		-melee attack
		-melee attack connected
		-run
		-dash
	
	bow throws spells or shoot arrows with effects where they land
	shield hit stuns hitter
	add queue for deletion timer to dualslicer, failsafe if death animation doesnt complete
